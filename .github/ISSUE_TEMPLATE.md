Thank you for your interest in improving the CDF Landscape!

For Missing or Incorrect Items on Landscape:

If you see an error in the cards, or missing ones, please don't create an issue here.
Instead, edit landscape.yml and open a pull request.
Then, review the preview staging server that's posted to your pull request and add a comment if your new or updated card looks correct and is ready to merge.
Please carefully review the sections of the README covering new entries, logos, and corrections.

### Bug report or Feature or Category request:

**Please note by far the quickest way to get a new feature is to file a Pull Request.**
